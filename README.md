Guild Trade Festival city route maker

Open the cityGoods.txt file and you'll see 3 columns.

The first colomn shows the city, the second shows their specialty item, 
and the third shows an item they are short on.

Assuming that the 2nd column doesn't change, 
the third column should be rewritten 
with the scarce city item after each event reset.

Note that you may need to change the specialty column for either changes made in game 
or to use your own acronyms/shorten names as I have.

Once everything is set, run the script and you'll find two cityRoutes text files.

The cityRoutes.txt file has printed cities and their routes in an order and notation fitted 
to be copied and pasted on the graph editor website https://csacademy.com/app/graph_editor/.

From there, the graph will be automatically created. Press the "Directed" button on the top left, 
and move around the nodes to better fit their positions to your liking.

If you don't like the limitations of the website or the general look of the edges, backgrounds, or nodes, 
then you can use the cityRoutes2.txt file, which is virtually the same just slightly prettier, 
to manually create the graph here https://graphonline.ru/en/?graph=PfqxiGJWLzvBqLQj.

On the site, the base graph should already have all the nodes laid out. 

If not you can import the base.graphml file by pressing "Graph" near the top left then "Import from file".

You can change the background color by right clicking an empty space and clicking "Background".

Connecting nodes with one initial click of "Connect Vertices" 
then two subsequent clicks for each cities you want to connect.

Unlike the other site, this one gives two seperate curved edges for a round trip between two cities 
as opposed to just one straight line with arrowed tips.

If you have any questions or suggestions, then @ me on discord.
